2:T444,In my professional tenure at ChargeItPro Inc., a reputable third-party payment processing software company, I provided integral account-level support during the tumultuous era of the EMV chip card rollout. This experience served as my initiation into the realm of full-stack software, where I grappled with the complexities of local server installations, API integrations, and regulatory compliance within the US banking infrastructure. Despite the challenges, our collaborative efforts as DevOps and support teams yielded stability amidst the chaos, proving invaluable during the transition to new ownership under Gravity Payments.Reflecting on my role, I navigated a diverse array of responsibilities, from handling incoming support calls to acquiring new skills in network administration, PCI-DSS compliance, automation testing, and agile methodologies. Although I missed out on an opportunity for a tester position, I acknowledge the pivotal role this experience played in shaping my multifaceted skill set, even amid personal challenges such as divorce and continual financial hardships.0:["Y_7KD78xVhf1QRz2f3-jR",[[["",{"children":["about",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["about",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},["$L1",[["$","div",null,{}],["$","main",null,{"className":"flex container m-auto","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"container flex flex-col text-center","children":["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl","children":"About Me"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"container flex flex-col bg-gray-700 bg-opacity-50 rounded m-2 p-2","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"my-2","children":"Greetings!
